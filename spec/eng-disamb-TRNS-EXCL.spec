#The lexical category "preposition" in English is homonymous in the way 
#that most of the words which are listed as preposition also belong to several 
# other lexical categories. The file is a subsection of the file 
# "eng-disamb-PRP-TRNS-EXCL.spec" which consists of words which
# are homonymous with prepositions, but which are, according to information 
# based on the context, are are particles which are modifiers of verbs or 
# clauses, or they represent some other lexical category. The words which 
# are connected with a small contexts are collected from a kwic concordance 
# consisting of the occurrences of the words collected from running texts 
# which contains the English translation of the Bible. The following words 
# with small contexts are separated from the kwic concordance manually: 
# above, after, against, along, aside, before, behind, by, 
# down, in, near, nigh, on, out, over, under, and up. 
# The file is a preliminary work prepared for testing of disambiguation 
# of lexical categories of words occurring as prepositions in English. 
# The list is not proofread yet, and there are some occurrences which have 
# to be evaluated with larger contexts. The other ambiguous prepositions 
# have to be included in the file later (cf. the text, Table 16).
